# nbproject

Light-weight Jupyter notebook manager. Track metadata, imports, and integrity.

---

ðŸ’¡ We recommend [lamindb.track()](docs:lamindb.track) instead of `nbproject` to:

- consistently track data sources across notebooks, pipelines & apps
- full provenance for datasets that you pull and push from notebooks
- manage notebook copying & integrate with Google Colab

Like `nbproject`, `lamindb` is open-source.

`nbproject` will continue to be maintained as a utility for `lamindb`.

---

Supported editors & platforms:

- Jupyter Lab
  - any pip or conda installation, a brew installation may give a problems
  - Saturn Cloud ([run](https://github.com/laminlabs/run-lamin-on-saturn))
  - Google Cloud Vertex AI (see [setup faq](faq/setup))
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code (no interactive experience, not recommended for production)

For broader support and features, see `lamindb.track()`.
