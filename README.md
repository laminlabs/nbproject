# nbproject

Light-weight Jupyter notebook manager. Track metadata, imports, and integrity.

---

ðŸ’¡ We recommend [lamindb.track()](https://lamin.ai/docs/ref/lamindb.track) instead of `nbproject` to:

- consistently track data sources across notebooks, pipelines & apps
- full provenance for datasets that you pull and push from notebooks
- manage notebook copying & integrate with Google Colab
- broader compatibility

Like `nbproject`, `lamindb` is open-source.

`nbproject` will continue to be maintained as a utility for `lamindb`.

Install: ![pyversions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/nbproject)

```
pip install nbproject
```

Get started:

```
import nbproject

nbproject.header()  # Tracks notebook, displays metadata

# do things

nbproject.publish()  # Checks consecutiveness, bumps version
```
