# Setup guide

## Google Cloud Vertex AI

For both managed and user-managed notebooks:

```
pip install ipylab==0.5.2 --user
pip install nbproject
```

After the installation, close the Vertex Jupyter Lab interface page and open it again.

Note: ipylab 0.6.0 is not yet compatible with current Vertex AI but likely will be in the future (2022-08-29.)
