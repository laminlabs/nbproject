# Tutorials

## 1: Manage tutorials interactively, one by one

```{note}

Each of the following pages is a Jupyter notebook, which you can download and execute yourself.

```

- {doc}`initialize`
- {doc}`basic-metadata`
- {doc}`dependency-tracking`
- {doc}`add-dependencies`
- {doc}`publish`
- {doc}`published`

## 2: Manage a collection of existing notebooks

- {doc}`cli`

## 3: Build APIs on top of nbproject metadata

- {doc}`meta`

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1
:hidden:

initialize
basic-metadata
dependency-tracking
add-dependencies
publish
published
cli
meta
```
