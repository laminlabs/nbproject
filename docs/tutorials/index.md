# Tutorials

Get started with managing notebooks interactively, one by one.

```{note}

Each of the following guides is a Jupyter notebook, which you can download and execute yourself.

```

- {doc}`initializing`.
- {doc}`basic-metadata`.
- {doc}`dependency-tracking`.
- {doc}`publishing`.

Manage a collection of notebooks with the CLI.

- {doc}`cli`.

```{toctree}
