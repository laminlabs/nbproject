# Tutorials

Get started with managing notebooks interactively, one by one.

```{note}

Each of the following pages is a Jupyter notebook, which you can download and execute yourself.

```

- {doc}`initialize`
- {doc}`basic-metadata`
- {doc}`dependency-tracking`
- {doc}`publish`

You can also manage a collection of notebooks with the {doc}`CLI <cli>`.

If you want to build APIs on top of nbproject metadata: {doc}`meta`.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1
:hidden:

initialize
basic-metadata
dependency-tracking
publish
cli
meta
```
